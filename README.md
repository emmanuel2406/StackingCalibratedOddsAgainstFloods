Accurately predicting weather events has long been a scientific challenge, but modern advancements in weather technology have greatly improved the availability and structure of historical meteorological data. In this paper, we focus on Bangladeshâ€”a country shaped by its extensive river systems and frequently affected by seasonal floods. Reliable forecasts of daily rainfall can significantly aid in flood preparedness and disaster mitigation.

Our goal is to develop a predictive model that satisfies two key criteria: (i) robustness, particularly for the positive class (i.e., when there is rain), and (ii) interpretability, where a predicted probability of, say, 0.8 should correspond to an 80\% empirical frequency of rain. To achieve this, we propose a methodology that combines classical machine learning models using stacking, and improves interpretability through calibration.
